# TV Script Generation

This project is a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I generated [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. 
I used part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
